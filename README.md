Project I worked on in July 2014 that changes the wallpaper of a Windows computer based on the time of day.

Used Java, Eclipse, bat scripting, and PowerShell.

The code was lost after I switched from my Windows desktop to my MacBook.

Converts the current time HH:mm:ss to HHmmss and adds a # to the beginning so it looks like so:
#HHmmss

The program then paints a 1920x1080 image with that specific color code and sets it as the background.
